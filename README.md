# Cropping Tool with OpenCV

**"Ever noticed how the Snipping Tool works?"**

Click. Drag. Capture.  
It's seamless — you select the area you need, and boom, you've got the exact region cropped out.

This project replicates that simplicity using Python and OpenCV. A lightweight tool that lets you interactively select and crop a part of any image. No heavy GUI libraries. Just the basics — clean and functional.
